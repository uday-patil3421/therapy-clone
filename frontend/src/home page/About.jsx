            Finding time and opportunities to care for ourselves can be
            incredibly challenging in today's busy and demanding world. I
            believe therapy offers a dedicated space for self-care, providing
            the support and tools needed to improve this essential practice.
            Therapy can help individuals identify and clarify their goals,
            values, and the various elements that contribute to their
            well-being, recognizing that these aspects vary from person to
            person.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am dedicated to supporting this journey by offering active
            listening, psychological knowledge, empathy, compassion, and
            insights into behavioral patterns and tendencies. I hold a masterâ€™s
            degree in Clinical Psychology from the Michigan School of Psychology
            (2012) and a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Western Michigan
            University (2018). My experience spans therapy and psychological
            assessment in psychiatric inpatient units, academic medical centers,
            universities, and outpatient practice settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            My therapeutic approach is primarily psychodynamic and humanistic,
            enriched by influences from positive psychology, existentialism,
            family systems theory, acceptance and commitment concepts, and
            mindfulness practices.
